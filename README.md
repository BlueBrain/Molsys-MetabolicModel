# MetabolicModel Project

## Repository Overview

This repository is organized into two main directories related to the research on multiscale electro-metabolic modeling of rat neocortical circuits.

---

## **1. EnergyCostMultiscale_run**

This folder contains the simulation setup and configuration files related to the article:  
**"Title To be asked Jay."**  
by [Author(s)]

### Contents include:
- Simulation configuration files:
  - `simulation_config.json`
  - `node_set.json`
  - `circuit_config.json`
- Example batch scripts (`simulation.sbatch`)
- Script to compute the Energy Usage using the data obtained from the two simulations in the repository
- Instructions for running the simulations

## **2. Multiscale_electrometabolic_ratneocortex**

This folder contains the code and information related to the article:  
**"A Multiscale Electro-Metabolic Model of a Rat Neocortical Circuit Reveals the Impact of Ageing on Central Cortical Layers"**  
by Sofia Farina, Alessandro Cattabiani, Darshan Mandge, Polina Shichkova, James B. Isbister, Jean Jacquemier, James G. King, Henry Markram, and Daniel Keller.

### Contents include:
- Figures and data analysis scripts
- Electrical models of the neurons
- Julia code for the Young and Aged metabolic simulations
- Simulation configuration files:
  - `simulation_config.json`
  - `node_set.json`
  - `circuit_config.json`
- Instructions for running the simulations and Jupyter Notebooks

## Instructions

Both projects use Multiscale Orchestrator. You can find the detailed setup and usage instructions in the official [MultiscaleRun documentation](https://multiscalerun.readthedocs.io/stable/) and on the [MultiscaleRun GitHub repository](https://github.com/BlueBrain/MultiscaleRun/tree/main). More details specific to each project can be found in the `README` files within each respective folder.
